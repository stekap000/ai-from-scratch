## ai-from-scratch

Implementation of neural network with arbitrary number of layers.
Training is done with backpropagation.
Provided in the form of STB-style library.
The goal is not to have neural network optimized via CPU and GPU, but
to develop intuition through straightforward and clear implementation.
